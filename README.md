## Summary 

Magic Potion is a single-page web application that displays a form for processing user orders. 

<img src="https://imgur.com/uorz0rT.png" width="800" />

The form allows users to select a quantity of Magic Potion items to order and displays a total based on the item price. After the user inputs required identifying information including their name, email address, phone number, address and payment method, the form submits a POST request to the server API, which creates an order in the database. 

Users are allowed a total of three Magic Potion items per month (e.g. a user may place more than one order in a given month, but the total quantity of items ordered may not exceed 3).

#### Tech Stack
This project is built with Laravel (PHP), React and the `react-hook-form` package.

## About the app

### Data Model

The Magic Potion app is built on four models: `User`, `Address`, `PaymentMethod` and `Order`. 

#### User
A `User` represents a single user who may place an order. `User`s have the following properties:
```
'id': integer
'first_name': string
'last_name': string
'email': string
'phone': string
'created_at': datetime
'updated_at': datetime
```
Our data model assumes that `User`s have a one-to-one relationship with both `PaymentMethod`s and `Address`es. A `User` can have many `Order`s; however, they are limited to 3 orders per month. These collections can be accessed with the `payment_method()`, `address()` and `orders()` methods, respectively.

`User` objects also have access to a method called `orders_per_month()` which takes in a given `date` array, and calculates the quantity of items ordered in that month.

#### Address
An `Address` contains details about a `User`'s address. `Address`es have the following properties:
```
'id': integer
'street_1': string
'street_2': string
'city': string
'state': string
'zip': string
'user_id': string
'created_at': datetime
'updated_at': datetime
```
Our data model assumes that `Address`es have a one-to-one relationship with `User`s. This collection can be accessed with the `user()` method.

All `Order`s associated with an `Address` can be accessed via the `orders()` method.

#### PaymentMethod
A `PaymentMethod` represents credit card details for a `User`. `PaymentMethod`s have the following properties:
```
'id': integer
'card_number': string
'expiration_date': string
'user_id': string
'created_at': datetime
'updated_at': datetime
```
Our data model assumes that `PaymentMethod`s have a one-to-one relationship with `User`s. This collection can be accessed with the `user()` method.

All `Order`s associated with a `PaymentMethod` can be accessed via the `orders()` method.

#### Order
An `Order` represents a request from a `User` to order up to a quantity of three Magic Potion items. `Order`s have the following properties:
```
'id': integer
'quantity': integer
'user_id': integer
'address_id': integer
'payment_method_id': integer
'fulfilled': boolean
'created_at': datetime
'updated_at': datetime
```
Our data model assumes that `Order`s have one-to-one relationships with `User`s, `PaymentMethod`s and `Address`es. These collections can be accessed with the `user()`, `payment_method()` and `address()` methods, respectively.

An `Order` object also has access to a `total()` method, which calculates the dollar amount of the order's total based on the item price of $49.99. 

#### Assumptions
- The current architecture does not support multiple product offerings. This means that every `Order` is implicitly specifying a quantity of Magic Potion items to order, with a set price of $49.99. In the future, we could scale the functionality of our app by providing multi-product support. One potential implementation could include introducing data models such as `PurchaseOrder` (to represent the intent to order multiple items) and `ProductOrder` (to represent the intent to order a single product item, in the context of a `PurchaseOrder`). We would also need to introduce a `products` table and associated `Product` data model, which would include information necessary to build and calculate orders. Each of these improvements would necessitate migrations of our current tables.
- For simplicity, the current architecture assumes that a `User` has a one-to-one relationship with an `Address` and `PaymentMethod`. In the real world, a person might want to place orders to a work address and a separate home address, or they could have two different credit cards that they use. Updating these associations to be one-to-many would allow for greater flexibility.

### Frontend architecture

### API architecture

### Potential future optimizations

- Support for multiple products
- UI improvements (e.g. better validation error highlighting, stricter form inputs, etc.)
- More comprehensive error handling
- User authentication / security improvements
- Type checking, schema annotations and linting for PHP conventions
- Enhanced test coverage

## Running the app
While this app is served live on [Heroku](https://bf-magic-potion.herokuapp.com/), users can also clone the repository for local development. The following instructions assume that you have PHP (and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)), MySQL and NPM installed.

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/briafincher/magic-potion.git
cd magic-potion
```

Install dependencies:
```
composer install
npm install
```

To take advantage of default configuration, create a MySQL database named `magic`. Otherwise, you can update `'config\database.php'` and/or your local `.env` to point to a different database.

Run migrations:
```
php artisan migrate
```

Load frontend:
```
npm run development
```

Start the app:
```
php artisan serve
```

You can now view the app by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or localhost:8000.
